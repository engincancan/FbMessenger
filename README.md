#Installation

Replace `1234567890` by your facebook app id:

```
$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/engincancan/FbMessenger.git --variable FB_ID=1234567890
```
(Note that the Phonegap CLI didn't support `--variable` before version 3.6.3, so please use the Cordova CLI as shown above in case you're on an older version)
